"BACKGROUND:
Studies evaluating the prevalence of cerebral atrophy in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric measurements are rare.
OBJECTIVES:
To determine the prevalence of cerebral and corpus callosum atrophy in cSLE and to determine the possible relationships between atrophy and clinical, laboratory and treatment features of the disease.
METHODS:
We included 76 cSLE patients (69 women; median age 16 years) and 66 age and sex matched healthy controls. Neurological manifestations were analyzed according to the ACR criteria. SLE patients were further assessed for clinical and laboratory SLE manifestations, disease activity [SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)], damage [Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI)] and current and cumulative drug exposures. MRI scans were performed in a 3T Phillips scanner using a standardized protocol.
RESULTS:
cSLE patients had significant smaller cerebral (1067.9cm3 vs 1172.7cm3 ; p<0.001) and corpus callosum (11.6 cm3 vs 13.7 cm3 ; p<0.001) volumes than controls. The presence of structural abnormalities was observed in 42 (55.2%) cSLE. The presence of cerebral atrophy was associated with aCL (p=0.02), anti-dsDNA (p=0.02) and cumulative corticosteroid dose (p=0.02). The presence of corpus callosum atrophy was associated with low complement (p=0.006) and acute confusional state (p=0.01). Sera levels of S100&#946;, NF-H and the presence of anti-P were not associated with atrophy in these patients.
CONCLUSION:
Structural brain abnormalities were observed in 55.2% and associated with NP manifestations, aCL antibodies and corticosteroid use. Longitudinal studies have to follow these patients closely to determine permanent neurological damage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.","",5,
