"Prof. Edson Borin is a faculty member of the Institute of Computing, at the University of Campinas, Unicamp. Prof. Borin has worked as a Research Scientist at the Intel Labs, in California, where he investigated and developed dynamic compilation techniques to enhance state-of-the-art HW/SW co-designed microprocessors, including automatic binary parallelization, dynamic binary translation and optimization techniques and hardware support to accelerate single-threaded applications. During this period, Prof. Borin employed his microcode compression algorithms and tools to improve the manufacturing process of Intel microprocessors. Currently, he applies his knowledge on modern computer architecture and compilers to investigate techniques to optimize existing scientific and engineering computing applications.",0
